## Welcome to PadLAD website
This site is dedicated to creating tools that support the participatory design of learning analytics dashboards.

We aim Participatory Design at all levels:
* We organize Participatory Workshops to improve tools
* We collect and share feedbacks of experiments with various stakeholders (teachers, students, administrative, academics)
* We share our productions on GitHub and are happy to get some feedbacks and improvements.
* We disseminate our results thanks scientific publications and various medias.

Some work is in french, as it is easier to relate with french teachers and students. Some more international content will be progressively added.

### News
[Next scientific workshop will be in May 2022, during the RJC EIAH 2022 days](https://padlad.github.io/RJC-EIAH2022/)
