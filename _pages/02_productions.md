## PaDLAD productions
This page presents in an ante-chronological sequence the main tools we have developed for building a participatory toolkit for designing learning dashboards..
### LADStudio
LADStudio is a LAD design and generation tool that allows LAD designers, and more broadly all stakeholders to build and implement potentially complex dashboards by providing only the highest level of information.

### PaDLAD (Particpatory Design for LADs)
This second version of the kit, renamed PadLAD, includes new features: Persona, support for SenseMaking, more modularity...
